# Wood Land Hero

Wood Land Hero is a Unity game created for the NG For All Jam gamejam, centered around the theme of saving the forest. In this game, your goal is to plant trees and prevent the spread of fire, protecting the forest from destruction. 

## Gameplay

The objective of Wood Land Hero is to plant different types of trees strategically to create a barrier against the advancing fire. You start with a limited amount of money, which you can use to purchase various tree types from the in-game shop. Each tree type has unique properties and costs, so choose wisely!

As the fire progresses, you must continuously plant trees to block its path. The fire will consume any unprotected trees, so you need to plan your tree placement carefully. Your score increases based on the number of trees saved from the fire.
